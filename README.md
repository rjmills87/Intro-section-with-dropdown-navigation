### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The most notable thing I learned during this project was the use of the HTML <picture> tag for changing the Hero Image source for the different viewport widths.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to work through more Frontend Mentor challenges as I often struggle to come up with project ideas and they provide plenty of variety. I intend to work my up to more complex projects alongside learning new frameworks and technologies

### Useful resources

- [HTML <picture> Tag - W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - I was actually not familiar with the use case of this tag before the project however it is extremely useful for changing the image source for different viewport widths rather than writing out JavaScript to achieve the same result.
